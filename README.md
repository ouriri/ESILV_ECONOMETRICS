# ESILV_ECONOMETRICS
Hello students from l'ESILV. In this repo you will find the jupyter files that we saw during the TD and some elements that could help you to understand the course. I suggest you to follow the repo because I will certainly update this over the time. 

Some references in econometrics :
- Econometrie, W. Greene (language = fr, eng)
- Analyse des s√©ries temporelles, R. Bourbonnais and M. Terraza (language = fr)

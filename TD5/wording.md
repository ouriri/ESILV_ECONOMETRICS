# TD 5 - Factors model and PCA
The class will be divided in 10 groups to make a analysis on a suggested financial subject. There are 4 problematics :
- *Fundamental analysis* = Analyze how fundamentals influence earning profits by share
- *Financial distress* = Analyze how variables influence the financial distress
- *Exchange rate* = Analyze how exchange rates influence the EUR/DOL
- *CAC40* = Analyze how stocks influence the CAC 40

**You have two hours to do build your models. Once you finished, some groups will be selected to present the work to the class.**

You will work with google collab. Do not forget to install statsmodels in order to build regressions. Each groups will be separated in zoom classrooms. Of course I will supervise zoom classrooms during the TD. Note that interpretations have to be written on your notebook. 

## Questions 
- **(1)** Do the PCA of the data in order to understand the data (do especially a correlation circle see : https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5869986-perform-an-exploratory-data-analysis/6172111-analyze-the-results for example)
- **(2)** Explain, interpret your results in your notebook
- **(3)** Do a factor model and see how significants your model is (linear regression)
- **(4)** Compute the covariance matrix of your estimated parameters (beta*beta')
- **(5)** Do the ACP of this covariance matrix
- **(6)** interpret your results
- **(7)** Build a new linear regression model with the principal components
- **(8)** Intrepret your results
